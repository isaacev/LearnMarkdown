Sometimes, the emphasis of a word or phrase needs to be changed. For these times Markdown has **bold** and **italic** formatting.

*Note: Since both bold and italic text are used to modify formatting inside other elements such as headers and paragraphs, they are said to be **span elements***

### Italic text

Text can be italicized using either pairs of **single asterisks** or **single underscores**. Insert an asterisk or an underscore on either side of whichever text should be emphasized. Precisely which symbol is used does not effect the rendered output.

```editor
*Everyone* should use emphasis _sometimes_.

# Even *headers* can use more emphasis

Be careful, symbols *can't_ be mixed
```

### Bold text

Bold text can be formatted with either **double asterisks** or **double underscores**. Like with italic text, the symbol used is a matter of personal preference since the final output is the same.

```editor
Bold can be used to **highlight**.

It's __not__ very subtle.

Sometimes formatting needs to **_double up_**
```
