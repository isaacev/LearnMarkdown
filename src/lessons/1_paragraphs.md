In Markdown, the simplest element is the paragraph.

A paragraph is a block of text separated by at least **one empty line** above and below. Text without an empty line between them will be merged into a single paragraph.

*Tip: switch between **edit** and **view** modes to observe how Markdown is rendered*

```editor
The first paragraph. A paragraph can be as long or as short as needed.

The second paragraph.
Even though this text is on the next line, it will be merged into the second paragraph.
```
